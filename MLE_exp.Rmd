```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
e = sample(c(
  "the time between cars passing on a busy road (in seconds)",
  "the time taken to serve a bank customer (in minutes)",
  "the distance between potholes on a road (in miles)"), 1)

n = sample(4:8, 1)

You are interested in `r e`.
Assume that the data follows a $Exp(\theta)$ distribution, and the observations are independent.
After some research, you record the following data: `r data`

1. Determine the likelihood function for this data.
2. Hence find the log-likelihood function.
3. Write down the maximum likelihood estimate for $\theta$ using your answer from part 2.
4. (Optional) Verify that your answer to part 3 is a maximum.
