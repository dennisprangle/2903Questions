Solution
========

### Part 1

The likelihood is
$$
\begin{align*}
f(\underline{x} | \theta) &= \prod_{i=1}^n \theta e^{-\theta x_i} \\
&= \theta^`r n` e^{-\theta \sum_{i=1}^`r n` x_i} \\
&= \theta^`r n` e^{-`r sum(data)` \theta}.
\end{align*}
$$
(n.b. $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ are the observations)

### Part 2

The log-likelihood is

$$
\ell(\underline{x} | \theta) = `r n` \log \theta - `r sum(data)` \theta.
$$

### Part 3

Differentiating the log-likelihood gives
$$
\frac{d\ell}{d\theta} = \frac{`r n`}{\theta} - `r sum(data)`.
$$
Setting this equal to zero, we can calculate the value of $\lambda$ that maximises the likelihood as
$$
\hat{\theta} = \frac{`r n`}{`r sum(data)`} = `r round(n/sum(data), 2)`.
$$

### Part 4

Differentiating the log-likelihood again gives
$$
\frac{d^2\ell}{d\theta^2} = -\frac{`r n`}{\theta^2}.
$$
Since this is negative, our $\hat{\theta}$ value is a maximum of the likelihood.
