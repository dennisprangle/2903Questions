Question
========
  You are interested in temperature differences in a remote region of `r m`. The temperature is measured at various locations in the region, (in Â°C), and the following data is observed: `r x`  
  
_Hint: The probability mass function for a normal distribution is_  

_$$f(x|\mu,\tau)=\left(\frac{\tau}{2\pi}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}exp\left\{-\frac{\tau}{2}\left(x-\mu\right)^{2}\right\}$$_  

_where $-\infty<x<\infty$, $-\infty<\mu<\infty$ and $\tau>0$._

_If $X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{n}$ are independent $N(\mu,\frac{1}{\tau})$ random variables and $\mu$ has a prior distribution $N(b,\frac{1}{d})$ then the posterior distribution for $\mu$ is $N(B,\frac{1}{D})$, where $B=\frac{db+n\tau\underline{x}}{d+n\tau}$ and $D=d+n\tau.$_
