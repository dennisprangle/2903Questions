Question
========

Suppose that the `r p` distribution is $\theta `r condition` \sim N(`r mu`,`r sd2`)$. Calculate $\Pr(\theta `r s` `r x` `r condition`)$.


Solution
========
Using `R`, we can use ``r command`` to give:  

$\Pr(\theta `r s` `r x` `r condition`) = `r sol`$.
 
Or we could work by hand, using the method of **normalisation**: for both sides of $\theta `r s` `r x`$ subtract the mean (`r mu`) and divide by the standard deviation (`r sd`):

$\Pr(\theta `r s` `r x` `r condition`)
= \Pr \left( \frac{\theta-`r mu`}{`r sd`} `r s` \frac{`r x`-`r mu`}{`r sd`} `r condition` \right)
= \Pr(Z `r s` `r (x - mu)/(sd)`)$,

where $Z = \frac{\theta - `r mu`}{`r sd`}`r condition`$ so that $Z \sim N(0,1)$.

To get the final answer without the use of R, we would use statistical tables.
