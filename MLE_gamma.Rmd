```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
e <- sample(c(
  "the failure times of machine parts at a factory (in years)",
  "the size of insurance claims (in thousands of pounds)",
  "monthly rainfall (in mm)"), 1)

n = sample(2:8, 1)

You are interested in `r e`.
Assume that the data follows a $Ga(`r a`, \lambda)$ distribution.
After some research, you record the following data: `r data`

1. Determine the likelihood function up to proportionality for this data.
2. Hence find the log-likelihood function.
3. Write down the maximum likelihood estimate for $\lambda$ using your answer from part 2.
4. (Optional) Verify that your answer to part 3 is a maximum.
