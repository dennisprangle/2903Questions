Question
========
A veterinary scientist is studying an outbreak of `r d` in domestic `r s` in the UK. She has developed a blood test that is `r c`% effective in detecting the disease when it is present. However, the test also yields a "false positive" result for `r a`% of healthy `r s` tested. She believes that `r b`% of the UK's population of `r s` actually have the disease.

Calculate the probability that:

1. A `r s2` who tests positive actually has `r d`.
2. A `r s2` who tests negative does __not__ have `r d`.
