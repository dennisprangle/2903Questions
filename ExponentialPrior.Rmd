Question
========
You are analysing data from `r e`. The following times (in `r t`) between `r o` were observed: `r x`

1. 
It is assumed that the data are independent realisations of a random variable
$X\sim Exp(\lambda)$.
Explain why $Exp(\lambda)$ is a reasonable distribution to use.

2.
Derive the likelihood function for this model.

3.
A $Ga(`r a`, `r b`)$ prior distribution is used. Derive the posterior distribution.

4.
Calculate the mean, variance and mode for the prior and posterior distributions.

5.
You also want to investigate using a less informative prior.
A colleague suggests a $N(`r a`, `r b`)$ distribution.
Explain why your colleague has made a bad choice.
