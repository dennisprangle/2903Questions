              "the rate of radioactive particles emitted by an experiment (in particles per second)"), 1)

You are interested in `r e`.
Assume that the data follows a $N(`r mu`, \sigma^2)$ distribution, and the observations are independent.
After some research, you record the following data: `r data`

1. Determine the likelihood function for this data.
2. Hence find the log-likelihood function.
3. Write down the maximum likelihood estimate for $\sigma$ using your answer from part 2.
4. (Optional) Verify that your answer to part 3 is a maximum.
